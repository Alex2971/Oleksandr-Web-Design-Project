<p>As the base is overrun by alien creatures, the U.S. military arrives—not to rescue survivors, but to erase all evidence, including you. Gordon fights through Black Mesa’s collapsing environments, ultimately traveling to Xen to confront the alien leader Nihilanth.

<p>The story unfolds naturally through scripted in-game events.
Soldiers use cover, flank, throw grenades, and coordinate—rare for the time.

The game’s engine powered early versions of Counter-Strike, Team Fortress Classic, Day of Defeat, and more.
